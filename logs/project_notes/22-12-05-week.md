## Organizational

## Environment
### Obstacles

### Collision Check
### Reward Func
#### Sub sparse Rewards
  
## Algorithm
#### SAC-X
#### SAC
##### JUMP START IDEA
- [X] use the transitions that come from "astar pretraining" at the start of every episode where we 
	  also generate a new environment right? So that we have the transitions of the correct path in the replay buffer for that environment added as the last entry and train normally after that until the end of the episode/new environment generation.
  -  exactly!
  -  [X] but the other version performs better?? (FELIX)
    - should be okey to use it like this as well
    - but it is kind of resembling to brute-forcing
  - we expect that the agent avoids u shaped stuck situations but if it cant 
### Policy
### Networks
#### Inputs
#### Outputs

## Optimizer -> **after midterm**
- [ ] Batchsize 512 too small for 20x20 size?
- [ ] or learning rate too slow
### Loss
## Performance
- [ ] solve const exploration decaying alpha - see sb3 for implementation / see original SAC paper (MO)
### Curves
- [X] why does sigma behave differently for x,y directions in both normal and pretrain (FELIX)
  - this may be a result of the grid world 
  - [ ] see if this changes when we switch to continious env. -> **after midterm**
- [ ] Meaning of jumps in the curves (FELIX)

### Google Cloud
- [X] how to have several working version on gcloud (FELIX)
  - [ ] stable version branches
  - wandb also creates an experiment branch for every run
    - project -> run -> name-of-run -> overview -> git-state
- [X] location storing pitfalls in gCloud (FELIX)
  - there were no problems
  - disk space and storing fees are neglectible 
- [X] or should we use scp (FELIX)
  - [X] permission denied with scp (FELIX)
  - [X] https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/transfer-files#transfergcloud (VOLKAN)
- [X] do we also pay if its idle? (FELIX)
  - yes we do
  - close the instance when we are done

## MILE STONES

### MIDTERM
- [X] smoothing
- [X] obstacle sorting
- [X] 2 pretraining ways
  - [ ] seperated performs better, but why? 	
- [X] seeding for environments
- [X] decaying alpha for entropy factor
  - [X] yes named entropy factor 
- [X] sub sparse rewards
  - [X] checkpoint
  - [X] time

- [ ] Presentation structure (FELIX)

- [ ] use all features and turn them off one by one to see their effects

- [ ] compare SAC vs SAC-X from the main version 

### ENDTERM

#### REPORT
- fix the feature set we want to try
- write everything beforehand 
- set placeholders for results
- additional performance and adn features after the presentation are good but doenst change the presentation grading
- but the presentation if graded based on the methodology 
  - so if there was a mistake at the presentation fix that afterwards before giving in the report
