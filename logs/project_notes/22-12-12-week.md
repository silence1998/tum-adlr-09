## Optimizer -> **after midterm**

### Loss
## Performance -> **after midterm**
- [X] only pretrain and see the result as well (MO)
- [ ] 5 variations for learning rate and batch size and check performance 
- [ ] OR use random search, but takes lots of time 
- [ ] use a curriculum
  - to make the start easier we can have the goal closer and push it away over time
  - e.g. increase the radius of initial goal distance every 10000 steps
  - switch to harder env, like 5-10-15 obstacles etc.
### Curves -> **after midterm**
- [ ] the jumps in the environment can be explained easily by plotting the grid world in the training 
  - [ ] VISUALs during the trainign e-g- every 10000 steps
  - [ ] and grid world may be causing a problem
    - [ ] this can be a local minima for example moving back and forth on a line

### Google Cloud -> **after midterm**
- [ ] cache replay buffer 
  - maybe store it in a numpy file
- [ ] setup gcloud auto email for crashes, if that doesn't work use wandb
- 


## MILE STONES

### MIDTERM
- [ ] reherse the presentation
  - bell rings on 1 min left
  - be precise with number that we show, their units, and maybe formula
- Report
  - what we achieved 
  - what we will still do to achieve the research goals
	- comparing 2 methods e.g. SAC SAC-X
### ENDTERM

#### REPORT
