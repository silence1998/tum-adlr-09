## Organizational

## Environment
### Obstacles
- [ ] Felix if we should focus on SAC-X or moving obstacles for midterm (FELIX)
  - we prefer to switch the SAC-X first because SAC doesn't perform well even in static environment
  - [ ] how to train SAC w/o jump start trick better for static environments (FELIX)

### Collision Check
### Reward Func
#### Sub sparse Rewards
  
## Algorithm
#### SAC-X
#### SAC
- [ ] SAC-X better for motion planning in static env against normal SAC?
##### JUMP START IDEA
- [ ] do a short google search for research based version
- [ ] use this at midterm
  - normal SAC doesn't perform well
  - it converges to a large sigma
    - [ ] on how to train the network for it (FELIX)
  - [ ] try SAC-X
### Policy
### Networks
#### Inputs
- [ ] set seed for environment e.g. environment: obs,    
  - how to have several environments with 1 seed?
    - where should we define it (FELIX)
#### Outputs
