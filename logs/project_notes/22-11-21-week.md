# 22 11 21 Weekly Meeting

## Organizational

## Environment
### Obstacles
### Collision Check
### Reward Func
- checkpoint wise subsparse works
#### Subsparse Rewards
- [ ] target distance checkpoint reward value
- [ ] waiting reward value
- [ ] e.g. moving 10 step in 1 direction reward value
  
## Algorithm
#### SAC
- [ ] SAC-X better for motion planning against normal SAC?
##### JUMP START IDEA (MO)
- [ ] does it actually help, can we test it like the following:
    - [ ] gridsize: 20 -> 400 possible positions -> 160.000 possible paths
        - pretrain:SAC_Train episode ratio 
        - 0:200 -> sigma ~ 1
        - 50:200 -> sigma ~ 0.6
        - 200:200 -> 
        - 200:10 ->  
        - 200:1 -> 
        - num episodes not enough regarding the possible paths
    - [ ] gridsize: 5 -> 25 possible positions -> 625 possible paths
        - we can try if the astar solution for every target&start pair helps overall or not
        - pretrain:SAC Train episode ratio
### Policy
### Networks
#### Inputs
#### Outputs

## Optimizer
- [ ]  Reparam noise?
    - gives the actor net the ability to explore
- [ ]  Value loss 0.5?
    - might be a trick
    - check stable baselines or the original SAC paper

### Loss
- [ ] negative loss?
## Performance
### Google Cloud
- [ ] Visual Introduction

## MILE STONES
### MIDTERM
