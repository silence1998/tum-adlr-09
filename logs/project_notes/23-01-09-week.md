## Algorithm
#### SAC-X
- start without pretraining to test the papers method
- train with scheduler
- run the robot on main task only which is the super sparse reward
  - possible problem: main task can get stuck
  - activate the needed subtask by check if the agent is not moving double the waiting  


- regular sac w/o pretrain STATIC
- regular sac-x w/o pretrain STATIC

- regular sac w/o pretrain DYNAMIC
- regular sac-x w/o pretrain DYNAMIC


- then sac with pretrain DYNAMIC
- then sac-x with pretrain DYNAMIC
  - OPTION 1
  - [ ] simulate that we used scheduler
  - OPTION 2
  - do pretrain on static initial env
  - then let it figure out




- [ ] more subtasks than 3
  - [ ] waiting 
  - ...
